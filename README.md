# Data-Analysis

Hello! I'm Lu, and this is my Data Analysis portfolio! 
I have recently discovered an interest in data analysis which pushed me to learn R and SQL. I've only just started but I feel like I'm making progress quickly! 
Here you will find some of the projects I have carried out so far, both in SQL and in R. I will make sure to update this regularly, so stay tuned to see what projects I'm gonna work on next!
If you're interested in collaborating on a project, or if you're looking for a Data Analyst to join your team, don't hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/lucrezia-romani
